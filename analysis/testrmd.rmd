# Question 1: GLMMs
## Methods
The present study aimed to investigate whether comprehension accuracy is lower for literary metaphors than non-literary metaphors, whether fluid intelligence and crystallized intelligence affect metaphor comprehension, and, if yes, whether there is a difference between literary and non-literary metaphors. Data was obtained from [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/metaphor.RData]: a dataset containing information on `r n_unique(metaphor.df$SubjectCode)` adults (50 F, 25 M, 1 not specified\footnote{Given that there was no reason to hypothesize a difference in task performance based on gender, the non-binary participant was included in the sample. For the same reason, gender was not included as a covariate in the models.}) with a mean age of `r mean(metaphor.df$Age)` (SD = `r sd(metaphor.df$Age)`, range = `r range(metaphor.df$Age)`). Participants were tested on two experimental conditions---literary metaphors (e.g, *A body is a prison for the soul.*, and `r n_unique(metaphor.df$Item)/2` non-literary metaphors (e.g., *The nose is the antenna of scent.*). Each condition consisted of with `r n_unique(metaphor.df$Item)/2` items, resulting in a stimuli set of `r n_unique(metaphor.df$Item)` items. Participants were also administered two psychometric tests, Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPM); scale = 0 to 12) and the Semantic Similarities Test (SST; scale = 19 to 37) to measure fluid intelligence, i.e., non-verbal problem solving, and crystallized intelligence, i.e., semantic knowledge, respectively. 



A quantitative, cross-sectional design was implemented which entailed a within-participants/between-items factor---all participants saw all items from two conditions, but each item belonged to only one condition. 
All analyses were carried out in R [@RCoreTeam2022]. To answer the research questions, participants' correct responses were modeled using multiple linear regression. Effects were considered statistically significant at $\alpha$ = 0.01. Given that the dependent variable was binary, a generalized linear mixed-effects model was specified with the logit link and binomial distribution using the lme4 package [@lme4]. A maximal model was first specified following recommendations by @Barr2013.  Condition (reference level: Literary), and standardized SST and RPM scores were included as the main predictor variables along with two separate interactions between condition and SST, and condition and RPM. By-subject random intercept and slope were added for condition and both interactions along with a by-item slope. The maximal model did not converge and the model simplification procedure specified in @Barr2013 was followed. First, the correlation was suppressed, followed by elimination of the interaction term in the random effects structure. The maximal model and the resulting final model were specified as follows:

<center>
**Maximal Model:** Correct ~ Condition * (SST + RPM) + (1|Item) + (1 + Condition *(SST + RPM) | Participant)


**Final Model:** Correct ~ Condition * (SST + RPM) + (1 | Item) + (Condition || Participant)
</center>


The *performance* package [@Ludecke2021] was used for model checks. The test for multicollinearity revealed low correlations between predictors (VIF < 2) and test for autocorrelation revealed that the residuals were independent and not autocorrelated (p = 0.080). 


## Results

**Descriptive Statistics:**
 A full report of the descriptive statistics can be found in Appendix A.1. The raw dataset contained `r nrow(metaphor.df)` observations with no missing or unlikely values. In terms of the psychometric measures, participants scored an average of `r mean(metaphor.df$RPM %>% round(3))` (SD = `r sd(metaphor.df$RPM %>% round(3))`) on the RPM (scale: 0-12), and `r mean(metaphor.df$SST  %>% round(3))` (SD = `r sd(metaphor.df$SST  %>% round(3))`) on the SST (scale: 19-37). Both psychometric measures were standardized for use in the statistical models. The mean proportion of correct responses of the sample was `r mean(metaphor.df$PropCorrect %>% round(3))` (SD = `r sd(metaphor.df$PropCorrect %>% round(3))`) with `r sum(metaphor.df$SubjectOutliers)/40` participants scoring lower than 0.737, the lower bound of the IQR*1.5 range. Initially, it seemed that this could be due to the participants not attending to the tasks as the STT and RPM were also very low (and even 0 in some cases). However, visual checks of SST and RPM scores showed all participants within range, i.e., no outliers. Therefore, the decision was made to keep the data of the eight low scoring participants. The same method was used to check for outliers in the stimuli set. `r sum(PropItemCorrect$outliers)` items were found to elicit a high proportion of incorrect responses. No exclusions were made at this stage, but models were run with and without these items (see Appendix A.2 for results of models without outliers). 


**Model Results:** 
Full regression results converted to odds ratios including 95% Confidence Intervals are shown in Table \@ref(table). Results show a significant difference in correct responses to the two types of metaphors ($\beta$ = `r table.m.2.1$estimate[2]` SE = `r table.m.2.1$std.error[2]`, p = `r table.m.2.1$p.value[2]`), suggesting that non-literary metaphors were `r table.m.2.1$estimate[2]` times more likely to be comprehended correctly than literary ones. RPM ($\beta$ = `r table.m.2.1$estimate[3]` SE = `r table.m.2.1$std.error[3]`, p = `r table.m.2.1$p.value[3]`) was found to be a significant predictor of correct responses, as was SST ($\beta$ = `r table.m.2.1$estimate[4]` SE = `r table.m.2.1$std.error[4]`, p = `r table.m.2.1$p.value[4]`). This suggests for every 1 SD increase in RPM, individuals are `r table.m.2.1$estimate[3]` times more likely to correctly comprehend metaphors. Similarly, for every 1 SD in SST, individuals are individuals are `r table.m.2.1$estimate[4]` times more likely to correctly comprehend metaphors. In other words, individuals in the 66th percentile of the SST and RPM scale are more likely to correctly comprehend metaphors, regardless of their type, `r table.m.2.1$estimate[3]` and `r table.m.2.1$estimate[4]` times, respectively. No significant interaction was found between condition and RPM ($\beta$ = `r table.m.2.1$estimate[5]` SE = `r table.m.2.1$std.error[5]`, p = `r table.m.2.1$p.value[5]`) and condition and SST ($\beta$ = `r table.m.2.1$estimate[6]` SE = `r table.m.2.1$std.error[6]`, p = `r table.m.2.1$p.value[6]`), suggesting that  RPM and SST only have an effect on overall metaphor comprehension, and do not favor one type of metaphor over another. 

```{r table,  results="asis"}
pander(tidy(m.2.1,conf.int=TRUE,exponentiate=TRUE,effects="fixed"), caption = "Regression Results (Converted to Odds Ratios)")

```

The results presented here indicate that overall individuals seem to comprehend non-literary metaphors better than literary ones, and that individuals with higher levels of fluid intelligence and/or crystallized intelligence are able to better comprehend metaphors. However, the effects of RPM and SST seen here are global and there is no evidence to show that they differ based on the type of metaphor.

However, it is important to note that these results should be interpreted with caution as the analyses were carried out on the assumption that the participants' were first language (L1) speakers of English. It widely known in the field of Second Language Acquisition that L2 speakers have difficulty in processing and acquiring formulaic language, of which metaphors are a subset [see @Carrol2020]. If this were the case, it could explain the lower accuracy in the literary condition. Furthermore, the dataset gives no indication if the items were controlled for frequency, word length, and other factors that could potentially affect comprehension and therefore should have been included in the model to account for variance. Finally, there is no information about the order in which stimuli were presented to participants which if not individual and randomized would lead to confounds in the results.

## Methods

To investigate whether attachment at age 3 partly mediates an association between maternal depression and later child emotional problems a structural equation model (SEM) was fitted, wherein maternal depression, maternal emotional availability, child anxiety, and child depression were latent variables defined by six items for maternal depression and four items for the rest, all measured on a five point Likert scale. Data was obtained from [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/msmr_2122_assignment.csv]: a dataset containing information on 700 mothers on ratings of depression and availability when their child was 3 yrs of age and at age 6, the children's teachers rated their emotional problems in terms of anxiety and depression. Skewness and kurtosis checks indicated that the data were normally distributed.

All analyses were carried out in R [@RCoreTeam2022] using the 'lavaan' package [@lavaan]. First, the measurement models were tested by fitting a one-factor CFA model for maternal depression and maternal emotional availability each, and a two-factor CFA model including child anxiety and child depression for child emotional problems. Latent variables were scaled by fixing the loading of the first item for each construct to 1. Models were judged to fit well if CFI and TLI were >.95 and RMSEA and SRMR were <.08. Models were judged based on maximum likelihood estimations and inspections were carried out to see if there were any modification indices or expected parameter changes that could be made. However, owing to the lack of theoretical rationale, no modifications were made. Furthermore, the dataset contained `r sum(is.na(emotional.df))` missing values. However, it was not possible to deduce whether there were any patterns in the missing data from the information at hand. These data points were dealt with using the Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) method. 

Next an SEM was specified wherein maternal availability and depression were regressed on child emotional problems which consisted of an aggregate of child depression and child anxiety. In addition, child depression and child anxiety were allowed to covary. The indirect effect of maternal depression on child emotional problems was calculated as the product of the effect of the predictor, i.e., maternal depression on the mediator, i.e., maternal availability and the effect of the mediator on the outcome. The statistical significance of the indirect effects were evaluated using bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals with 1000 resamples. The full SEM model is illustrated in figure \@(pathdiagram). Solid lines indicate that a parameter is significant at p<.05, while dashed lines represent non-significant paths. 

## Results

All measurement models fit well (CFI and TLI>.95 and RMSEA and SRMR<.08). The full structural equation model also fit well (CFI=1.00, TLI=1.00, RMSEA <.001, SRMR=0.023). Standardised and unstandardised parameter estimates are provided in Table 3. All hypothesised paths were statistically significant at p <.05. The indirect effects of depression ($\beta$=0.176, 95% CI=0.121-0.239) on emotional problems were statistically significant. These significant indirect effects suggested that maternal availability  at age 3 mediates the effect of maternal depression on child anxiety and depression at age 6. Maternal depression also has a direct effect on child anxiety and depression. Results thus provide support for the theory that maternal availability in early childhood mediates the effect of depression on children's emotional problems later in childhood.
